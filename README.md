API Options
REST: Representational State Transfer, a web architectural style for designing networked applications with a stateless communication model.

GraphQL: A query language and runtime for APIs, enabling clients to request only the data they need.

WebSocket: A communication protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, ideal for real-time applications.

gRPC: A high-performance, open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that uses HTTP/2 for transport and Protocol Buffers as the interface definition language.

MQTT: Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, a lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices, ideal for low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks.

Serverless: A cloud computing model where cloud providers automatically manage the infrastructure, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code without worrying about server provisioning or maintenance.
